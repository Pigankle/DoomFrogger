**Welcome to Doom Frogger** 

Do you worry about existential crises?  Famine?  Pestilence? Machine Superintelligence?  Do you wish you could just put  blinders, and all the bad things would go away?

If so, then this is the game for you.


1. Doom Frogger is a simple game.  Use the arrow keys to navigate the screen.  Be careful - there are occasionally 
inconvenient truths zipping across.  They can really sting!
2. To counteract the sting of these carbingers of doom, collect roses.  They smell nice, and can distract you from the bad news that pervades.
3. If you run out of roses, then your next bit of bad news might do you in.
